Learning in the workplace can be as simple as learning the task of logging onto your computer and as complex as learning a multi-week business process. Across an enterprise organization, many individuals will be required to learn the same or similar operational processes. Since human beings are unique in there learning styles, it is essential that training techniques be customized to enhance human learning performance across a diverse workforce. Intelligent agents represent an emerging paradigm where adaptive task selection is coupled with autonomous control. Agents represent a promising technology for delivering specialized training to their human counterparts by customizing instructions in multiple modalities. Insight into how an individual learns a specific business process can be used to enhance that business process for the best performance. This paper discusses the rationale for a personal learning assistant agent customized for business processes","2161-3761;21613761","","10.1109/ICALT.2006.1652651","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1652651","","Adaptive control;Business communication;Business process re-engineering;Databases;Employment;Humans;Industrial training;Intelligent agent;Management training;Programmable control","intelligent tutoring systems;management education;management training;software agents","adaptive task selection;autonomous control;business process learning;enterprise organization;human learning;intelligent agents;personal learning assistant agents;specialized training","","0","","4","","","5-7 July 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Within this framework, we studied the extent to which BPR promotes organizational learning by focusing on the project group and the steering committee. This paper is based partly on a theoretical study of the significant characteristics of BPR and of organizational learning and partly on a field study carried out in cooperation with the business unit of Enzyme Business, Novo Nordisk A/S. The result of the analysis is that a correlation between BPR and organizational learning has been established, i.e. the BPR elements: customer focus, process orientation, high level of ambition, clean sheet principle, performance measuring, the business system diamond, and continuous improvements promote organizational learning. However, the high level of ambition, the clean sheet principle and a narrow focus on carrying out a project quickly may have the opposite effect, thereby preventing the organization from learning, and potentially failing to contribute to the avoidance of strategic drift","","","10.1109/HICSS.1998.648330","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=648330","","Biochemistry;Business process re-engineering;Companies;Continuous improvement;Electrical capacitance tomography;Engineering management;Environmental management;Manufacturing industries;Testing;US Department of Transportation","commerce;systems re-engineering","Enzyme Business, Novo Nordisk;ambition;business process reengineering;business system diamond;business unit;clean sheet principle;company learning ability;continuous improvements;customer focus;organizational learning;performance measurement;process orientation;project group;steering committee;strategic drift","","0","","57","","","6-9 Jan 1998","06 Jan 1998-09 Jan 1998","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It will utilize contextualized communication for teaching, and not burden experts with additional tasks; and it will be based on knowledge sources available within an organization. The outcome of APOSDLE will be a methodology, software framework and reference architecture for workplace learning enhancing the learning processes for the individual and the organisation. In order to ensure the general applicability of this outcome an application-driven approach is used to cover the needs of three fundamentally different organizations: a network of SMEs, a public organization, and a large corporation.","0537-9989;05379989","","10.1049/ic.2005.0769","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1576049","","","computer aided instruction;industrial training;production engineering computing;teaching","APOSDLE project;contextualized communication;knowledge management;learning processes;software framework;teaching process;workplace learning","","0","","","","","Nov. 30 2005-Dec. 1 2005","","IET","IET Conference Publications"

In order to let machine know the business rules, parts of business process, we need to translate them into a language which machine can understand. Object constraint language is one of those languages. In this paper we present a statistical machine learning method to understand the natural business rules and then translate them into object constraint language. Subsequently a translation algorithm for business process modeling is also provided. A real case, air cargo load planning process is proposed to illustrate the efficiency and effective of the method and the algorithm. The result has shown that this method and algorithm enrich business process modeling technology and enhance the efficiency of software developers in business process modeling.","","","10.1109/KAMW.2008.4810674","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4810674","Business Process;Object Constraint Language;Statistical Machine Translation","Constraint optimization;Humans;Laboratories;Learning systems;Machine learning;Machine learning algorithms;Natural languages;Power system modeling;Programming;Unified modeling language","business process re-engineering;language translation;learning (artificial intelligence);natural languages;statistical analysis","business process modeling technology;natural business rules;natural language understanding;object constraint language translator;statistical machine learning","","0","","14","","","21-22 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Students playing vendors and purchase roles were organized into teams who meet, collaborate, and negotiate business transactions in the virtual environment. The aim of the experiment was to introduce students to properties of ERP-systems which are the most common software systems used by businesses, and at the same time introduce tools for virtual team collaboration in an international setting between students in Norway and Australia.

This system is used to manage and analyze the running business process in the company. Every business process has a possibility to have changes in its realization. Those changes generate some variations of the business process. The variations, can be in line with the company's principles and or become an anomaly for the company. These anomalies can cause frauds which make some losses for the company. In order to reduce the losses, business process anomaly detection method is needed. This paper proposed ontology-based process modeling to model and capture the business process anomalies and the method of multi-level class association rule learning (ML-CARL) to detect fraud in business process. From the experiment which have been done in this paper, the accuracy of 0.99 was obtained from the ML-CARL method. It could be concluded that ontology-based process modeling and the ML-CARL method can detect business process anomalies well.","","","10.1109/IC3INA.2015.7377738","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7377738","formatting;insert;style;styling","Association rules;Companies;Data models;OWL;Ontologies;Standards","business data processing;data mining;ontologies (artificial intelligence);security of data","BPMS;ML-CARL;business process anomaly detection;business process management system;multilevel class association rule learning;ontology-based process modelling","","","","21","","","5-7 Oct. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
