Proceedings. Fifth International Conference on","","2003","","","3","10","Negotiation is a key component of e-business. Like business in the real world, negotiation often occurs between two parties or among parties. Considering how to settle on the terms of a transaction, negotiation varies in duration and complexity depending on the market. In general, people are directly engaged in a negotiation process with common knowledge, their experience, and certain learning or reasoning strategies. The human involved negotiations accrue transaction costs that may be too high for either consumers or merchants. Software agent technologies can be used to automate several of the most time-consuming stages and help human combat information overload and expedite specific stages of the business process. The agent-mediated e-business systems are creating new markets (low-cost consumer-to-consumer goods) and beginning to reduce transaction cost in variety of business processes. With a rational negotiation model, software agents should be able to negotiate in an intelligent way on behalf of the real-world parties they represent. However, one of the challenging problems here is negotiation modeling. How to precisely reflect human's negotiation process on different levels is a crucial point. This paper presents our studies on negotiation modeling and demonstrates the negotiation model based e-shopping agents.","","","10.1109/ICCIMA.2003.1238085","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1238085","","Competitive intelligence;Computational intelligence;Costs;Counting circuits;Decision making;History;Humans;Intelligent agent;Software agents","electronic commerce;inference mechanisms;learning (artificial intelligence);negotiation support systems;software agents","business processes;consumer-to-consumer goods;e-business;e-shopping agents;information overload;learning strategy;negotiation modeling;reasoning strategies;software agent;transaction costs;transaction process","","4","1","17","","","27-30 Sept. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Continuous relationship with customer and customer process supports life cycle learning and knowledge catching. Whole the value network around the customer process is continuously searching balance between effectiveness and profitability over the life cycle. Business transition is difficult to execute if the networked business is not understood from system point of view through ""big picture"" of the business and if suitable collaborative performance metrics is not used. There have been many attempts to describe industrial service in the form of ""big picture"". Some of them have been too complicated, some too simple, some are biased serving only single point of view. Service excellence means understanding of the whole business picture. That system model leads us to the roots of service excellence. Service excellence can be continuously measured and followed by indicators looking from various viewpoints. Some of the indicators are based on balance scorecard key performance indicators. Some of the viewpoints are such that there have not been used any indicators. Emotional aspects or future service opportunities are not yet addressed by any indicators. Emotional factors become more and more important on service implementation. Enterprise brand image is also important in successful service marketing. By mastering innovation in open environment over customer process life cycle it is possible to achieve leadership in life cycle business transition. Innovation is taking place in three dimensions, business, customer and life cycle innovation. Spiral innovation process over the three dimensions of this hybrid innovation enables new type of business transition with lower risk level. Business co evolution is taking place on boundaries of business models, networks a- d deliverables. Performance metrics should align to translate vision to action and establish the criteria for business process optimization. This article introduces new concept on management of business transition by system model of the networked business and new type of performance indication system.

On the basis of this discussion the authors present a business game construction based on continuous processing. Furthermore, some preliminary findings of the game utilization in a university course are represented. The emphasis of the paper is on business process gaming, not business process simulation. The difference between these two is that the focus of simulation is on designing processes, but the focus of gaming is on facilitating business process perception of game participants.

International Conference","","1996","","","386","391","The Computer Science and Software Engineering degree at Swinburne has a strong emphasis on student projects. Students undertake a sequence of three such projects: a small team project in Ada in first year; a small team project with database orientation in second year; a large team project in Ada, with a real-time distributed system orientation in third year, after students have spent a year on placement in industry. Our experience has been that the first two projects have generally served their purpose quite well. The technical simplicity of the projects has not detracted from the process-oriented learning goals we have for our students, and the small team size (generally around four) has enabled management to proceed relatively smoothly. We are pleased to concur with the literature on the basic success of the small team project model. However the situation with the large final year projects has been rather different. To date (over three years) we have not had any project that we could happily describe as exemplar of our ideals. Often the student experience has been of desperate measures taken to ensure that software is delivered, quite against the principles of their software engineering education. Our desire to encourage the development of distributed real-time systems, integrating a variety of heterogenous commercial software products (such as Alsys Ada, Oracle, Telesoft TeleUse) has resulted in real-life frustration, as students have battled with technology rather than appreciated wise process. Further, we have not discovered an assessment scheme ideal for the purpose of the project. In summary, what promised to be an interesting learning experience for our students, aimed at consummating the thrust of the degree, has to some extent failed to deliver. We feel that we need to reconceptualise the large team project in our context. The paper describes an attempt to address the development of a framework for the conduct and assessment of large project subjects, inspired by the SEI Capability Maturity Model for Software. We observe that the primary requirements for projects concur well with the requirements for level 2 (Repeatable) in the CMM. We describe an action learning experiment, still in the embryonic stage, where we impose a CMM level 2 framework on the conduct of student projects.

A user (client) of the software uses a browser to operate it while the actual software may be located locally or remotely. Different techniques have evolved with time for implementation of such software within the basic client/server architecture. The initial development environment used a browser (as a client) and a Web server/HTML/CGI (as a server). Of late, technologies like CORBA, DCOM, etc., are becoming popular. Whatever the development environment or implementation technique, such software development is still a tedious job and requires the software developer to be an expert of various technologies. Such scenarios naturally demand a good development tool such that the whole development cycle is small and efficient and the pressure of learning different technologies for a software developer is reduced. We present our effort of designing and implementing such a tool, named IMIS. There are two major components in IMIS: the specification component and the implementation component. In the former, we specify the business process and the latter implements the specification. The core of the specification is the language in which the business process is specified and stored. The implementation component of IMIS will consist of the tools which produce the final customized MIS based on the specification which executes in an Internet/intranet environment","","","10.1109/TENCON.1998.797051","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=797051","","Application software;Business communication;Computer architecture;Computer science;Internet;Object oriented modeling;Programming;Software standards;Software tools;Web server","Internet;client-server systems;formal specification;intranets;management information systems","CGI;CORBA;DCOM;HTML;IMIS;Internet/intranet environment;MIS development;Web server;application software;browser;business process;client/server architecture;customized MIS;de facto standard environment;development cycle;development environment;development tool;implementation component;implementation technique;software development;specification component","","0","1","6","","","1998","17 Dec 1998-19 Dec 1998","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In general, machine-learning-based business process automation is still viable with reduced classification accuracy due to such false decisions, thanks to business models that replace human decision processes with automated decision processes covering the costs of introducing automation and the losses from rare mistakes by the automation with the profits from relatively large savings in human-factor costs. However, under certain conditions, it is possible for attackers to outsmart a classifier at a reasonable cost and thus destroy the business model that the learner system depends on. Attackers may eventually detect the misclassification cases they can benefit from and try to create similar inputs that will be misclassified by the unaware learner system. We call adversaries of this type ""opportunistic adversaries"". This paper specifies the environmental patterns that can expose vulnerabilities to opportunistic adversaries and presents some likely business scenarios for these threats. Then we propose a countermeasure algorithm to detect such attacks based on change detection in the post-classification data distributions. Experimental results show that our algorithm has higher detection accuracy than other approaches based on outlier detection or change-point detection.","2166-0778;21660778","","10.1109/SRII.2012.24","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6310988","Anomaly detection;Machine learning;Opportunistic adversary","Automation;Business;Decision trees;Humans;Insurance;Machine learning;Training","business data processing;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;security of data","change-point detection;countermeasure algorithm;human decision processes;imminent threats;machine-learning-based business process automation;misclassification cases;opportunistic adversaries;outlier detection;post-classification data distributions;real-world classification problems;reduced classification accuracy","","0","","20","","","24-27 July 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper is based partly on a theoretical study of the significant characteristics of BPR and of organizational learning and partly on a field study carried out in cooperation with the business unit of Enzyme Business, Novo Nordisk A/S. The result of the analysis is that a correlation between BPR and organizational learning has been established, i.e. the BPR elements: customer focus, process orientation, high level of ambition, clean sheet principle, performance measuring, the business system diamond, and continuous improvements promote organizational learning. However, the high level of ambition, the clean sheet principle and a narrow focus on carrying out a project quickly may have the opposite effect, thereby preventing the organization from learning, and potentially failing to contribute to the avoidance of strategic drift","","","10.1109/HICSS.1998.648330","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=648330","","Biochemistry;Business process re-engineering;Companies;Continuous improvement;Electrical capacitance tomography;Engineering management;Environmental management;Manufacturing industries;Testing;US Department of Transportation","commerce;systems re-engineering","Enzyme Business, Novo Nordisk;ambition;business process reengineering;business system diamond;business unit;clean sheet principle;company learning ability;continuous improvements;customer focus;organizational learning;performance measurement;process orientation;project group;steering committee;strategic drift","","0","","57","","","6-9 Jan 1998","06 Jan 1998-09 Jan 1998","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The goal of these languages is to glue Web services together in a process-oriented way. For this purpose, these languages typically borrow concepts from workflow management systems and embed these concepts in the so-called ""Web services stack"". Up to now, little or no effort has been dedicated to systematically evaluate the capabilities and limitations of these languages. BPEL4WS for example is said to combine the best of other standards for Web service composition such as WSFL (IBM) andXLANG (Microsoft), and allows for a mixture of block structured and graph structured process models. However, aspects such as the expressiveness, adequacy, orthogonality, and formal characterization of BPEL4WS (e.g. reachability) have not yet been systematically investigated. Although BPEL4WS is not a bad proposal, it is remarkable how much attention it receives while more fundamental issues such as semantics, expressiveness, and adequacy do not get the attention they deserve. Therefore, we advocate the use of more rigorous approaches to critically evaluate the so-called standards for Web services composition, and to learn from 25 years of experiences in the workflow/office automation domain.","1089-6503;10896503","","10.1109/EURMIC.2003.1231605","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1231605","","Business data processing;Internet;Specification languages","Internet;business data processing;specification languages;workflow management software","Internet;Web service composition languages;office automation;workflow management systems","","17","","24","","","1-6 Sept. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These facts limit the reusability of process models across different standards and contexts. To overcome these issues, we introduce an innovative semantic Web service-based framework aimed at changing the current paradigm to a context-adaptive service-oriented approach. Following the idea of layered semantic abstractions, our approach supports the development of abstract semantic process model-reusable across different contexts and standards - that enables a dynamic adaptation to specific actor needs and objectives.

PICMET '97: Portland International Conference on Management and Technology","","1997","","","883","","Summary form only given. Many new modern management approaches have been introduced in order to survive in the intense competition of the global market. Benchmarking, total quality management, learning organisation, manufacturing resources planning, total productive maintenance, and business process reengineering are some of them. While entering the 21st century, Turkey, as a rapidly developing country, has aimed to take a place in the international markets. For that reason it has signed Custom Union (CU) Agreement with EC countries and declared its intent to join the EC. This means that all Turkey's companies must be ready for competing at the sharpest edge of global markets. Turkey's companies must achieve breakthrough performance enhancements to reach the EC's continuously improving companies' level. So what is the need then? Radical redesign and management of systems, policies, structures and finally the culture. Focusing on Turkey's specific conditions, it seems only BPR can promise to gain a sustainable advantage in competition in order to survive. In that way, we have been trying to establish a systematic methodology for Turkey's companies to apply the BPR principals by a specific model which allows them to gain necessary breakthrough performance enhancement. Although it is for Turkey's specific conditions, our model may be a sample for many developing countries and can be used with simple modifications. Our proposed model aims to clarify the rules of BPR for companies which are interested in investing in it","","","10.1109/PICMET.1997.653691","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=653691","","Atmosphere;Business process re-engineering;Companies;Customer satisfaction;Environmental management;Globalization;Knowledge management;Management training;Planning;Technological innovation","international trade;management;management of change;systems re-engineering","EC countries;Turkey;business process reengineering;competitive advantage;developing countries;global markets;international markets;management;performance enhancements","","0","","","","","27-31 Jul 1997","27 Jul 1997-31 Jul 1997","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These are often business practices outside of traditional roles. This requires a competency in change agency. In developing a competence in change agency, individuals must learn to see when the necessary elements of change are in place and action is required. Individuals must also learn how to put these necessary elements in place. At Intel the product life cycle (PLC) was deployed from its organizational beachhead to across the company over a period of many years. The PLC is an example of driving a non-traditional business process across many organizations. Lessons learned from this example accelerated the deployment of other non-traditional business processes at Intel.

"Situation-driven processes for Semantic Web Services","S. Dietze; A. Gugliotta; J. Domingue","Knowledge Media Institute, The Open University, MK7 6AA, Milton Keynes, UK","2008 International Conference on Service Systems and Service Management","","2008","","","1","5","Process models to support user objectives are used across several domains, such as eLearning or Business Process Management. Usually, specific metadata schemas, such as the XML bindings of the Business Process Modelling Notation (BPMN) or IMS Learning Design (IMS LD), are used to enable interoperability. Since Web services which are used throughout a process at runtime, are allocated statically within the process model at design-time, their dynamic adaptability to distinct situations is highly restricted. Whereas the aforementioned process models define a process from a user perspective, Semantic Web Services (SWS) technologies, such as WSMO or OWL-S, define processes from a system perspective by enabling the semantic description of services and data to support their automatic discovery and invocation to achieve specific user tasks at runtime. However, until now, a common link is missing to bridge between a processpsila user perspective and its system perspective. In this paper we propose a metamodel for Situation-Driven Processes (SDP) which enables the description of a process in terms of specific process situations which each is linked to a specific user Goal (user perspective) as well as a set of Brokered Goals (system perspective). Since Brokered Goals are gradually derived from SWS Goals, a process is accomplished dynamically at runtime in terms of SWS Goal achievements. As a result, following an approach of situation-driven process generation at runtime, we support the dynamic composition of a process appropriate for a given situation and its automatic transformation into distinct process metadata standards.","2161-1890;21611890","","10.1109/ICSSSM.2008.4598524","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4598524","IRS-III;Process Management;Semantic Web Services;WSMO","Bridges;Electronic learning;Knowledge management;Process design;Runtime;Semantic Web;Simple object access protocol;Software standards;Web services;XML","Web services;XML;meta data;ontologies (artificial intelligence);open systems;semantic Web","IMS learning design;OWL-S;WSMO;XML bindings;automatic transformation;brokered goals;business process management;business process modelling notation;eLearning;interoperability;metadata schemas;semantic Web services;situation-driven processes","","0","","19","","","June 30 2008-July 2 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Universities typically only offer functional courses without considering the communication and social aspects of BPM. This paper describes a single course unit for BPM at universities disseminating not only theoretical knowledge but also practical application and communication skills. Additionally, problem-based learning and role play simulation have been identified as pedagogical foundations. This Social BPM Lab is based on the Horus Method which comprises relevant aspects of Business Process Management and fosters interactions between students through social media in a lab context.

For modeling services with flexibility, service decoupling feature based on events is utilized to decouple different parts of a business process, and to independently define process fragments. Process coordination logic among different process fragments is extracted as independent building blocks such that its enactment can be adapted at run-time.

Existing approaches treat a log record as an instance of one workflow model. They do not deal with interleaved logs, where each log record is a mixture of multiple workflow traces. However, such an interleaved log is typical for many systems especially web-based ones where all the user-system interaction traces are recorded and maintained by a web server. Dealing with interleaved logs is challenging due to the lack of prior knowledge of workflow models and noises contained in the log data. In this paper, we propose a two-phase workflow learning process. During the first phase, we use a probabilistic approach to learn the links between operations and the hidden workflow models. We consider a workflow model as a probabilistic distributions over operations and derive it through likelihood maximization. This allows us to identify the membership of an operation to a workflow model, which can be used to unravel a log record and generate a set of workflow instances from it. During the second phase, the sequential patterns between operations within each workflow model are derived from all its instances. We have conducted a comprehensive experimental study, which indicates the effectiveness of the proposed solution.","","","10.1109/ICWS.2014.38","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6928898","Process mining;interleaved logs;probabilistic models;topic modeling;workflow model discovery","Business;Computational modeling;Data mining;Equations;Hidden Markov models;Mathematical model;Probabilistic logic","business data processing;data mining;learning (artificial intelligence);statistical distributions;workflow management software","Web-based systems;business process mining;interleaved event logs;probabilistic distribution;two-phase workflow learning process;user-system interaction;workflow models","","1","","15","","","June 27 2014-July 2 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

More specifically, this paper describes an insight development process called Realsearch, and its application specifically to the analysis and design of highly adaptable business practices. Realsearch is an issue-focused, principle-based methodology that first defines the nature of a problem before considering solutions. Solutions are then analyzed or designed according to a set of fundamental design principles. Insight is fostered with this cause-and-effect understanding, and communicated within an organization through means of a local metaphor model-which provides a graphic depiction of this cause-and-effect relationship for a known and respected local business practice. One immediately practical application is for directing business process reengineering projects. Another is the capture and mobilization of corporate core competency knowledge. A third important application is in what we now call continuing education-at all employee levels. Insight provides a very different leverage over simple procedural learning and training. Formal education traditionally gives us new rules to employ, training traditionally gives us experience in applying those rules, workshops focus us (sometimes) on real and practical problems, and seminars expose us to someone else's thoughts.

SOA brings more agility and flexibility to business applications by emphasizing on reusing business processes and IT assets. It enables organizations, enterprises to easily integrate systems, data, applications and processes that are connected by the link of services. With the rapid development of Internet and modern education, the current education system is facing new problems, such as integrating the existing education software systems and the resources. Therefore, finding a revolution for education software design and development, and realizing the ranges from software engineering to software architecture is a key issue to many educators and researchers. In this paper, an approach of design and implementation of SOA-based computer aided learning platform is proposed as an attempt to solve the “information isolated island”, duplication development problem which exist in current computer aided educational system.

In this research work, an approach to the dynamic optimization of local decisions to assure global optimization in supply chain performance is developed within the framework of a collective intelligence (COIN). As a COIN, we mean a large multi-agent system where there is no centralized control and communication, but also, there is a global task to complete. The proposed framework is focused on the interactions at local and global levels with the agents in order to improve the overall supply chain business process behaviour. Besides, learning consists of adapting the local behavior of each entity with the aim of optimizing a given global behavior. Reinforcement learning algorithms are used at the local level, while generalization of Q-neural algorithm is used to optimize the global behavior. The framework is implemented over an agent platform. The work demonstrates that this problem is a good experimental field for the investigation and application of the COIN theory.","","","10.1109/IS.2004.1344783","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1344783","","Centralized control;Decision making;Learning;Mathematical model;Multiagent systems;Optimization methods;Production;Resource management;Supply chain management;Supply chains","decision making;learning (artificial intelligence);multi-agent systems;supply chain management","Q-neural algorithm;collective intelligence;decision making;dynamic optimization;global optimization;multiagent system;reinforcement learning;supply chain business process behaviour;supply chain management","","1","","12","","","22-24 June 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In the current state of practice, business processes are primarily designed by experienced business analysts who have extensive process knowledge. It is challenging for novice business analysts and non-professional end-users to identify a complete set of services to orchestrate a well-defined business process due to the lack of process knowledge. In this paper, we propose an approach to extract process knowledge from existing commercial applications on the Web. Our approach uses a Web search engine to find websites containing process knowledge on the Internet. By analyzing the content and the structure of relevant websites, we extract the process knowledge from various websites and merge the process knowledge to generate an integrated ontology with rich process knowledge. We conduct a case study to compare our approach with a tool that extracts ontologies from textual sources. The result of the case study shows that our approach can extract process knowledge from online applications with higher precision and recall comparing to the ontology learning tool.","","","10.1109/ICWS.2011.85","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6009404","Process knowledge acquisition;business process;ontology","Business;HTML;Ontologies;Process control;Semantics;Web pages","Web services;Web sites;business data processing;data flow analysis;knowledge management","Internet;Web search engine;Website;business process design;control flow;data flow;nonprofessional end-user;novice business analyst;process knowledge extraction;service composition","","2","","31","","","4-9 July 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Several predictive monitoring techniques have been proposed in the past. However, so far those prediction techniques have been assessed only independently from each other, making it hard to reliably compare their applicability and accuracy. We empirically analyze and compare three main classes of predictive monitoring techniques, which are based on machine learning, constraint satisfaction, and Quality-of-Service (QoS) aggregation. Based on empirical evidence from an industrial case study in the area of transport and logistics, we assess those techniques with respect to five accuracy indicators. We further determine the dependency of accuracy on the point in time during process execution when a prediction is made in order to determine lead-times for accurate predictions. Our evidence suggests that, given a lead-time of half of the process duration, all predictive monitoring techniques consistently provide an accuracy of at least 70%. Yet, it also becomes evident that the techniques differ in terms of how accurately they may predict violations and nonviolations. To improve the prediction process, we thus exploit the characteristics of the individual techniques and propose their combination. Based on our case study data, evidence indicates that certain combinations of techniques may outperform individual techniques with respect to specific accuracy indicators. Combining constraint satisfaction with QoS aggregation, for instance, improves precision by 14%; combining machine learning with constraint satisfaction shows an improvement in recall by 23%.","2168-2216;21682216","","10.1109/TSMC.2014.2347265","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6882809","Business data processing;failure analysis;forecasting;neural network applications;transportation","Accuracy;Business;Data models;Monitoring;Predictive models;Quality of service;Real-time systems","business data processing;constraint satisfaction problems;learning (artificial intelligence)","QoS aggregation;accuracy indicators;constraint satisfaction;machine learning;predictive business process monitoring techniques;process execution;quality-of-service aggregation","","3","","49","","20140828","Feb. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

As a corporate performance indicator, Tobin's Q has some inherent advantages compared to other accounting indicators, and it can better reflect the contribution of ERP investment to company performance. This study employs multiple regression models to examine the impact of ERP investment on Tobin's Q. The sample consists of 126 manufacturing companies listed on the Shanghai and Shenzhen Stock Exchanges from 1999 to 2007. Empirical results show that in the first three years after ERP implementation, there is no significant change in Tobin's Q; however, in the fourth year, Tobin's Q increases significantly. The results indicate that, as a strategic long-term investment accompanied by large-scale business process reengineering and organizational learning, ERP implementation has time-lagged effects; nonetheless, it eventually produces significant benefits.","","","10.1109/TST.2012.6216752","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6216752","Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP);Tobin's Q;company performance;time-lagged effects","Biological system modeling;Data models;Databases;Enterprise resource planning;Information technology;Investments","","","","0","","","","","June 2012","","TUP","TUP Journals & Magazines"

We present a machine learning component that combines two different machine learning algorithms. In this paper we focus mainly on the first one, which induces the structure of the workflow, based on the induction of hidden markov models. The second algorithm, a standard decision rule induction algorithm, induces transition conditions. The main concepts have been implemented in a prototype, which we have validated using artificial process traces.

This paper describes the concept for teaching requirements engineering that was devised at Coburg University of Applied Sciences. As a key idea, teaching requirements starts out from business process models. From these models, requirements for a workflow application can be derived and specified in a requirements document. A main benefit of this approach lies in the fact that requirements are not just presented as an abstract concept. Furthermore, students are exposed to the complexity of an almost realistic workflow application. Being more realistic than a toy project, the latter also improves understanding why requirements should be described precisely and provides opportunities to also exercise non-technical competencies that are important for successful requirements engineering.","1093-0175;10930175","","10.1109/CSEET.2014.6816776","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6816776","","Abstracts;Business;Complexity theory;Educational institutions;Software;Unified modeling language","computer science education;educational courses;further education;software quality;teaching","Coburg University of Applied Sciences;abstract concept;business process models;requirements engineering;software system quality;teaching requirements;university students;workflow application","","5","","22","","","23-25 April 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Traditionally, CASE tools have been considered as one of the most important means for implementing best practices. Today's CASE technology offers much process optimization and increases the options for how and where improvements could be done. However, CASE tool expenses are typically high due to their steep learning curve. The selection of the right CASE tool has, therefore become more important in ensuring the CASE investment delivers value for money. This paper introduces a best practice based approach to CASE tool selection so the potentiality of CASE tools to support the development of a process-oriented software organization can be assessed. The paper derives three sets of CASE attributes pertinent to the best practices addressed in three major reference process architectures: Capability Maturity Model for Software, ISO 9000-3 and Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award. The approach has been applied to three case studies dealing with 9 object-oriented and 7 conventional CASE tools.

Our approach to the architectural design of the e-learning environment considers the environment as a source of resources. It ensures two types of resources $learning resources and instructional resources. They are shared among two dynamic collections of individuals: learners and instructors. The coordination of resource sharing is a grid problem. Therefore, the architecture of the e-learning environment consists of two grid layers. The first of them is a grid of instructional resources. The second layer organizes the learning resources in another grid. The integration factor of this architecture is the instructor. He is an agent that uses the instructional resources for the production of learning resources.

Our best current method for doing this (100% observation) requires considerable time and resources. Industry has learned that activities can be assessed using statistical methods that ""sample"" the observable environment. Work sampling and related methods use probability theory to reduce the amount of time necessary to observe events or activities that do not occur in a systematic manner without loss of information.

This paper introduces the e-commerce integration strategy focused on the issues of resource-based view and its impact on firm performance. When the hard information resources of time, people and computers are wisely used, these make communication a core competence for the company. As the soft information resources are added, that is, the intellectual capital, knowledge sharing and willingness to learn, organizational culture and ideology is developed, which feeds business success. According to the resource-based view, the ability of a firm to develop capabilities enhances its ability to adapt to the changing competitive environment and improves its survival prospects. In this paper, several relationships are examined. 1st: Information resource integration and knowledge sharing would contribute positively to the organizational learning behaviors, and associate with the integration of firm's soft information resources such as organizational culture and ideology. 2nd: The integration of information resources and the extent of knowledge sharing in a firm would promote its business process improvement initiative. 3rd: Information resource integration and knowledge sharing in a firm would contribute positively to its service standardization integration. 4th: The integration of organizational culture and ideology and learning behaviors practiced by a firm would contribute positively to its service standardization integration. 5th: The extent of business process integration would contribute positively to its service standardization integration. 6th: Business process integration of a firm would associate with its firm performance. 7th: The standardization and quality of services offered by a firm would have a positive effect on its firm performance. The paper finds that information resource integration, business process integration, knowledge sharing and - organizational learning behaviors positively affect firm performance.","","","10.1109/ICMSS.2009.5300952","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5300952","","Companies;Feeds;Helium;Industrial economics;Information resources;Knowledge management;Quality of service;Resource management;Standardization;Technology management","electronic commerce;knowledge management","business process integration;e-commerce;firm performance;ideology;information resource integration;intellectual capital;knowledge sharing;organizational culture;organizational learning;resource-based integration strategy;service standardization integration;soft information resources","","0","","6","","","20-22 Sept. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

An implementation of an ERP system can achieve “real-time” and “integration”. The staffs with manipulation skills of an ERP system are thus demanded for enterprises. E-learning are increasingly widespread by using information and telecommunication technologies. Therefore, this study develops a Moodle-based e-learning framework, consisting of a Moodle learning management system with a mobile learning (m-learning) solution and Web 2.0 applications (such as Wiki), and a proposed planning template of an e-learning content development for manipulation skill training of an ERP system. This study exhibits an implementation demo of the proposed framework, and indicating that (1) the used Moodle LMS can support e-learning and m-learning well, (2) an e-learning content (HTML5 format) created by the proposed template can be easily delivered to a Web and mobile devices. In future work, this study will integrate the proposed framework with a flipped classroom approach for ERP courses in a University. A statistical questionnaire analysis method will be performed to verify that the proposed framework can efficiently acquire the manipulation skills of an ERP system for learners.","","","10.1109/ICEED.2015.7451504","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7451504","Moodle learning management system;e-learning;e-learning content development;enterprise resource planning;mobile learning","Business;Conferences;Electronic learning;Internet;Mobile communication;Mobile handsets;Training","Internet;computer based training;enterprise resource planning;learning management systems;mobile computing;statistical analysis","ERP system;Moodle learning management system;Moodle-based e-learning framework;Web 2.0 applications;e-business framework;electronic business framework;electronic learning framework;enterprise resource planning system;flipped classroom approach;information and telecommunication technologies;m-learning solution;mobile learning solution;process-oriented business management paradigm;statistical questionnaire analysis method","","","","14","","","17-18 Nov. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To improve the definition of the TV department business process requirements, we have applied a few methods to facilitate communications amongst stakeholders, based on their requirements. Our methods include iterative review processes, shared templates, and professional technical writing training. After applying our methods in a pilot project, the project stakeholders have confirmed that the approach provides a better requirements understanding and has improved requirements elicitation for the given examples. While implementing the project, we were also able to learn about both technical and nontechnical obstacles. Nontechnical obstacles were created by the organizational culture, including issues such as reduced empowerment, low levels of communication with other stakeholders, and a non-uniformly defined and not clearly understood mission statement. Most of the developers are very good at accomplishing their goals. They are very quick to respond to their management's requests, without excuses. However, often times, stakeholders have usually emphasized the importance of the results, rather than focusing on developing a strong quality process. The quality of work was highly dependent on the product development process. Therefore, in this study, the authors have analyzed the impact on the requirements gathering created by the stakeholders having a manufacturing process background and evaluating most decisions from a manufacturing perspective. The impact of the national cultural work style on the requirements engineering processes was also examined. In the future, we will continue to apply and expand the mentioned findings to further improve the requirements business process management.","","","10.1109/REBPM.2014.6890731","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6890731","Requirements engineering process improvement;national work patterns;organizational culture;product development process","Companies;Cultural differences;Global communication;Software;TV","business process re-engineering;continuous improvement;cultural aspects;electronics industry;formal specification;iterative methods;organisational aspects;product development","TV department business process requirements;business process improvement;electronics company;iterative review process;manufacturing process background;nontechnical obstacle;organizational culture impact;product development process;professional technical writing training;project stakeholder;quality process;reduced empowerment;requirements business process management;requirements engineering process improvement;requirements understanding;shared template;work quality","","0","","6","","","25-25 Aug. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Thus for HLI to remain competitive globally, innovation is essential. Innovation is required not only in the business process to aid in more efficient ways of conducting the business, but also in the teaching and learning method. Due to the recent technology of Web 2.0 and 3.0, learners are exposed to vast amount of information in which it is made accessible online. In addition to the Internet capabilities in providing vast amount of information, learners are also exposed to the global communication in which platforms such as social networking software like Facebook, Twitter, MySpace had allowed learners to communicate with others across the globe in the quest of finding information and getting related knowledge. This provisions had posed a challenge to the academics in the HLI to innovate their way of teaching and ensure what is delivered to the learners are not repetitive to what they have known before through online information. As such teaching and learning must be co-created between the instructors and learners and be viewed from the participative and service oriented approach. The participative approach emphasizes on the learners participation in real life exercise while the service-oriented approach promotes values that are co-created between the learners and instructors to create win-win perspectives for both parties. Therefore this particular work is geared towards innovating the teaching and learning method across two countries, to provide an experience to the learners in terms of life exposure working with various community from the other countries and bring to light the experience in interacting with others, difference in work culture between two communities, sharing of ideas, working in different time zones and using technology in communicating and delivering results.

If a business process changes state, it sends messages to relevant processes to inform about this change. However, server crashes and network failures may result in loss of messages. In this case, the state change is performed by one party, resulting in state/behavior inconsistencies and possibly deadlocks. Our basic idea to solve this problem is to cache the response (in a synchronous interaction) if the state of the process instance has changed by the request message. The possible state inconsistencies are recognized and compensated by state-caching and retrying failed interactions. By doing this work, we have learnt the possible failures caused by system crashes and network failures. Our results make it possible to build robust interactions by using cached-based process transformations.","","","10.1109/SCC.2013.39","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6649695","BPEL;Business Process;Service Interaction;State Synchronization","Automata;Business;Computer crashes;History;Petri nets;Servers;Synchronization","client-server systems;groupware;system recovery","BPEL;cached-based process transformations;collaborative process;network failures;robust client-server shared state interactions;service interaction;state synchronization;system crash","","1","","22","","","June 28 2013-July 3 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Use Cases may be modeled in a graphical way (e.g. using the UML notation), mainly serving as a table of content for Use Cases. System behavior can more effectively be specified by structured natural language (NL) sentences. The use of NL as a way to specify the behavior of a system is however a critical point, due to the inherent ambiguity originating from different interpretations of natural language descriptions. We discuss the use of methods, based on a linguistic approach, to analyze functional requirements expressed by means of textual (NL) Use Cases. The aim is to collect quality metrics and detect defects related to such inherent ambiguity. In a series of preliminary experiments, we applied a number of tools for quality evaluation of NL text (and, in particular, of NL requirements documents) to an industrial Use Cases document. The result of the analysis is a set of metrics that aim to measure the quality of the NL textual description of Use Cases. We also discuss the application of selected linguistic analysis techniques that are provided by some of the tools to semantic analysis of NL expressed Use Case.","1090-705X;1090705X","","10.1109/ICRE.2002.1048518","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1048518","","Application software;Books;Computer aided software engineering;Natural languages;Power system modeling;Software architecture;Software systems;Specification languages;Unified modeling language;Vehicles","formal specification;linguistics;natural languages;object-oriented methods;software metrics;software quality;specification languages;systems analysis","UML;Use Case analysis;business process requirements;experiments;functional requirements;functional system requirements;linguistic techniques;quality metrics;semantic analysis;software tools;structured natural language sentences","","20","2","19","","","2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

One of the largest discretionary spending categories is the cost of technical training provided by our equipment suppliers and the travel associated with sending senior equipment maintenance technicians and equipment engineers to lengthy training classes at locations around the world. A side effect of travel was that our most senior people would lose approximately 3 days of work time for travel before and after training. The challenge was meeting this aggressive cost reduction goal while maintaining high quality training and low production risk. We had two key opportunities. The first was available equipment capacity on our manufacturing floors, and second, we had motivated factory managers who challenged our training organization to create Lean and effective, affordable training. In 2009, the team deployed a pilot, transferred the key learning's to define and deploy the business process, systems, logistics, roles and collaterals to go from <;10% to over 90% of advanced training onsite.

Changes are happening in everyday life and one has to adapt to new situations and face challenges. Technical education is no exception to this phenomenon. There is need to change curriculum and traditional teaching methods. This paper focuses on `change management' and re-engineering of educational processes. IT has enormous potential and we can improve learning processes dramatically with IT as change enabler and innovation happens as a side product. Some of the paradigms discussed are business process re-engineering, Kaizen, and Six Sigma, e-learning etc. In spite of its complexity and long time taken for its implementation, reengineering the educational processes is the only solution to bring forth drastic changes and improvement in current educational systems. some of the problems in implementing BPR are resistance to change and lack of management support etc, resulting in failures. These problems can be circumvented by addressing critical success factors of Re-engineering. E-learning can be used successfully by harnessing the innovations happening in Internet and World Wide Web. In recent times emphasis is shifting from instruction paradigm to learning paradigm and a learner centric approach will promote active learning. A case study was presented which introduces a new paradigm for students, an E-learning system which offers opportunities for alternative form of learning using powerful Internet Web site content creation, maintenance and Web analytic tools.","2157-0981;21570981","","10.1109/ICTKE.2009.5397338","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5397338","Active Learning;Business Process Re-engineering;Creative Problem Solving;E-learning;Kaizen;Web based learning","Business process re-engineering;Computer science;Computer science education;Continuous improvement;Crisis management;Educational institutions;Educational products;Information technology;Internet;Technological innovation","Internet;Web sites;business process re-engineering;computer aided instruction","E-learning system;Internet Web site content creation;Kaizen;Six Sigma;World Wide Web;business process re-engineering;change management;educational processes re-engineering;learning process;teaching process;technical education","","3","","17","","","1-2 Dec. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Several processes are documented within, however, a methodology is not a process. It is the study of how processes operate and relate to one another. Our methodology attempts to answer the questions, ""What is the performance of our system?"" and ""What should it be?"" We are speaking generally about computer systems but some discussion of the business process those system supports is inevitable. Performance is measured many ways just as a car's performance includes acceleration, braking, cornering, and the balance among these factors. Unlike riding in a car, the best performing computer systems are those where the performance is least noticeable. Ironically, while we will talk very little about functionality, the goal of performance management is in large part to make the functionality of an application available to everyone who needs it. It is only when we consider the implications of this goal that we learn that we must not make the user wait, burden the system administrator with maintenance, or kill the bottom line with hardware costs. The best performing systems are those whose impact on users, system administrators, and accountants is low, balanced, and well understood","","","10.1109/EMAT.2001.991306","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=991306","","Acceleration;Accelerometers;Application software;Computer aided software engineering;Costs;Delay;Environmental management;Hardware;Testing;Time measurement","management;performance evaluation","Athens Group;business case;business process change;computer systems;functionality;high level performance model;metrics reporting;performance management cycle","","0","","","","","2001","16 Aug 2001-17 Aug 2001","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Continuous relationship with customer and customer process supports life cycle learning and knowledge catching. Whole the value network around the customer process is continuously searching balance between effectiveness and profitability over the life cycle. Business transition is difficult to execute if the networked business is not understood from system point of view through ""big picture"" of the business and if suitable collaborative performance metrics is not used. There have been many attempts to describe industrial service in the form of ""big picture"". Some of them have been too complicated, some too simple, some are biased serving only single point of view. Service excellence means understanding of the whole business picture. That system model leads us to the roots of service excellence. Service excellence can be continuously measured and followed by indicators looking from various viewpoints. Some of the indicators are based on balance scorecard key performance indicators. Some of the viewpoints are such that there have not been used any indicators. Emotional aspects or future service opportunities are not yet addressed by any indicators. Emotional factors become more and more important on service implementation. Enterprise brand image is also important in successful service marketing. By mastering innovation in open environment over customer process life cycle it is possible to achieve leadership in life cycle business transition. Innovation is taking place in three dimensions, business, customer and life cycle innovation. Innovation process over the three dimensions enables new type of business transition with lower risk level. Business co evolution is taking place on boundaries of business models, networks and de- iverables. Performance metrics should align to translate vision to action and establish the criteria for business process optimization. This article introduces new concept on management of business transition by system model of the networked business and new type of performance indication system. The concept has been developed and validated according grounded theory in the deep collaboration with ten enterprises.","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7462067","Business transition;Emotional factors;Industrial service;Service indicators;Spiral innovation","Analytical models;Collaboration;Companies;Complexity theory;Measurement;Technological innovation","","","","","","18","","","23-28 June 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Particularly in the context of call-centers a lot of customer related sensitive information is stored in audio recordings. In this work, we address the problem of protecting sensitive customer information in audio recordings and Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) transcripts. The high word error rates, spontaneous nature of communication and the variability in agent-customer interaction makes it harder and expensive to craft rules or build annotators to detect sensitive information. In this paper we propose a semi supervised method to model sensitive information as a directed graph which is automatically generated from ASR transcripts. Vocabularies specific to the nodes are generated using features of context sensitive clusters. The direction and weight of the edge capture the ordering and timing constraints respectively for these features. These constraints are learnt from the time stamps associated with ASR transcripts. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated by applying it to the problem of detecting and locating credit card transaction in real life conversations between agents and customer of a call center.","","","10.1109/SCC.2009.51","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5284020","","Audio recording;Automatic speech recognition;Companies;Credit cards;Data security;Information security;Outsourcing;Personnel;Protection;Usability","audio recording;call centres;data privacy;security of data;speech recognition","agent-customer interaction;audio recordings;automatic speech recognition transcripts;business process industry;call center recordings;context sensitive clusters;sensitive customer information protection","","0","","30","","","21-25 Sept. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The top-level business process architecture should be derived from the business strategy. The detail of the processes within a top-level process architecture cannot be founded on logic alone, there is a need to utilise the collective knowledge of the workforce to derive the business processes and for the workforce to learn more about their business in the experience. In engaging employees in the process definition, shared values as to the new processes are more likely to emerge. Indeed, a commonly reported failure of BPR initiatives (business process reengineering) is the failure to achieve buy-in from employees regarding the changes that need to be made to day-to-day operations. What better method to employ than soft systems methodology (SSM) (Checkland, 1981).

"A process-driven e-learning content organization model","Kwang-Hoon Kim; Hyuk-Jae Yoo; Hak-Sung Kim","Dept. of Comput. Sci., Kyonggi Univ., South Korea","Fourth Annual ACIS International Conference on Computer and Information Science (ICIS'05)","","2005","","","328","333","We have been trying to incorporate a concept of workflow (or business process) into a SCORM-based e-learning management system. As one of the results, we, in this paper, propose a new e-learning content organization scheme that is extendibly adopted into the SCORM content aggregation model for specifying a learning process in a SCORM-based learning management system. In terms of the representation of the e-learning activities sequencing and navigation, the current SCORM content aggregation model uses a rule-driven approach that defines the intended sequencing and ordering of learning activities inside of a tree-structured content organization, which means that not only it might be a very restricted and inflexible approach in specifying the learning activities' sequencing and ordering, but also there is no way for educators to be involved in, to maintain or even to monitor the learning activities during that a learner is learning or studying by itself through the system. In order to get rid of these restrictions, we would apply a process-driven approach to the SCORM content aggregation model. The approach intents to replace the SCORM's tree-structured content organization scheme by the concept of a process-driven content organization scheme in realizing the learning activities' sequencing and ordering functionality, and we call it a process-driven e-learning content organization model. In this paper we formally and graphically describe the model and show an example to explain how it works in composing a process-driven e-learning sharable content objects sequencing and navigation model. Also, we propose a possible system architecture of a process-driven e-learning management system.

Data collected during business process execution are used for deriving the key performance indicators (KPI) that allow continuous tracking of the process behavior and measurement of process-specific goals. KPIs evaluation leverages on business process monitoring solutions that can be embedded into the BPM execution framework or integrated as additional facilities. This paper presents an integrated framework that allows modeling, execution and analysis of business process based on a flexible and adaptable monitoring infrastructure. The main advantage of the proposed approach is that it is independent from any specific business process modeling notation and execution engine and allows for the definition and evaluation of user-specific KPI measures. An example of implementation of the proposed execution and monitoring framework as well as its validation on a real case study in the learning domain are also presented.","","","10.1109/ES.2015.23","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7406860","","Business;Context;Engines;Monitoring;Process control;Process modeling;Training","business data processing","BPM execution framework;KPI evaluation;business process execution;business process modeling notation;business process monitoring solutions;event monitoring activity;key performance indicators","","","","16","","","14-15 Oct. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The authors present several multimedia tutorials designed by the CAEME Center at the University of Utah which use applications and interactive experimental procedures for teaching engineering courses. The multimedia modules provide students with opportunities to conduct virtual laboratories and make observations that often lead to the derivation of mathematical equations. These tutorials employ applications in two different teaching strategies. In the first, applications are used as a concrete means of demonstrating the material being taught; while the other is in the conflict/resolution category, in which the student is given a design problem and must learn and apply engineering concepts and problem-solving techniques to arrive at a solution.

This system is used to manage and analyze the running business process in the company. Every business process has a possibility to have changes in its realization. Those changes generate some variations of the business process. The variations, can be in line with the company's principles and or become an anomaly for the company. These anomalies can cause frauds which make some losses for the company. In order to reduce the losses, business process anomaly detection method is needed. This paper proposed ontology-based process modeling to model and capture the business process anomalies and the method of multi-level class association rule learning (ML-CARL) to detect fraud in business process. From the experiment which have been done in this paper, the accuracy of 0.99 was obtained from the ML-CARL method.

The objective of minimizing the interference in the presence of radar signal and maximizing the spectral efficiency when radar signal is not detected are considered. In addition, the objective of minimizing the power consumption is also considered. The functionality of the process considers the operation of NI-USRP<sup>®</sup> device as SU and radar as PU over ISM-UHF band of 902-928MHz for attaining the fitness's of the SU parameters as desired.

In this paper, we present how such skills can be achieved by learning processes that are integrated to the tasks of the business processes of a knowledge centric organization. The gains of such learning processes are that they are just-in-time, tailored to their specific needs, and ideally integrated into day-to-day work patterns. In order to illustrate our approach we present an overview of the BPMN and show how it can be used for attaching learning objects to the business process diagram. Then we show how we attach metadata to the learning objects, called guides, and to the business process tasks. In order to standardize the used metadata items we have developed ontologies that give the semantics for the metadata items (keywords).

The process-oriented holonic modeling methodology has been used for total quality management and business process engineering exercises in different industrial sectors and builds models that connect the strategic vision of a company to its operational processes. Exercises have been conducted in response to environmental pressures to make operations align with strategic thinking as well as becoming increasingly agile and efficient.

It identifies decision point by looking for XOR-splits in petri-net workflow model and analyzing rules for each choice based on available attributes using decision tree. Problem emerges when decision mining technique is used on a workflow that does not use either XOR or AND splits, for example OR-split gateway logic. OR-split does not have explicit representation in petri nets and it makes decision mining algorithm cannot find its decision point. Workflow pattern that uses OR-split as its splitting logic is multi choice. Multi choice does not have its own explicit representation in form of petri net and it is problematic to apply decision mining to this workflow pattern. To make multi choice can be analyzed by decision miner some modification needs to be applied to the petri net representation of this pattern. This paper proposes modification of OR-split gateway representation in petri net. The new representation of OR-split uses combination the existing XOR-split and AND-split to make the model easier to be analyzed using decision miner. The proposed modification do not affect the conformance of event log and process model, but will allow each choice branch to be checked by decision miner.","","","10.1109/IC3INA.2013.6819197","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6819197","decision mining;decision tree;multi choice;process mining;workflow pattern","Analytical models;Companies;Decision trees;Logic gates;PROM;Routing","Petri nets;business data processing;data mining;decision trees;information retrieval;learning (artificial intelligence)","OR-split gateway representation;Petri net representation;Petri-net workflow model;XOR-splits;business process;decision mining;decision tree;information retrieval;machine learning technique;multi choice workflow patterns;process mining","","4","","16","","","19-21 Nov. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These changes are making it necessary to adapt the curriculum in order to develop the skills needed by the XXI century engineer. Moreover, instead of thinking in a large curriculum reform at a specific moment, it is necessary to define curriculum management processes that include change as a natural component of the process. In addition to these global trends, each institution has a particular context and thus, the analysis in each institution has unique characteristics, a common methodological approach, and a reference model that can be built as long as it is flexible enough to include that context. This paper describes a model developed for curriculum management inside the School of Engineering at Universidad EAFIT - Colombia. This model includes the institutional context and is based on a process approach defined by the Business Process Management (BPM) methodology. The model uses the Burlton Hexagon as a theoretical framework to identify organizational structure, strategies, policies, infrastructure, technology tools and human capital. It is also a mechanism for specifying curricular macro processes including the global and institutional context. The proposed model is based on three pillars: (a) scientific research in education, which promotes the use of the scientific method as a strategy to ensure an approach to problems based on evidence which allows the construction of educational innovation projects, (b) education engineering focused on engineering education, which transforms the learning by developing basic, professional, and transversal skills as well as those specific for an engineer of the XXI century, and (c) interactive educational communities, both face to face and virtual, as spaces for knowledge management that support collaborative working and experience-sharing, managed by its members working together promoti- g initiatives to develop educational innovation projects focused on specific topics, that answer questions related to teaching and learning needs. The formulation and development of educational innovation projects are the responses to different needs identified on specific courses that are transformed into research questions. These projects aim to renew the curriculum so that it dynamically evolves based on classroom experiences. Thus, the curriculum renewal is based on critical thinking about the problems found in engineering education. The use of the scientific method and the collaborative approach enables drawing solid conclusions based on the experimental results. The model proposes the formulation and development of innovative educational projects in which scientific research applied in education aims to transform teaching, academic and administrative practices. As consequence, curricular innovations that integrate learning objects and educational, methodological and assessment strategies, are developed by an interactive learning community composed by teachers. Finally, the results obtained by applying the model in some courses in the School of Engineering of Universidad EAFIT are presented. These results include reducing the drop-out rate of students, redefining admission and graduation profiles, and micro-curricular redesign based on competences using projects, among others.","0190-5848;01905848","","10.1109/FIE.2014.7044386","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7044386","Engineering education;curriculum development;educational innovation projects;interactive educational communities;process management;scientific research in education","Communities;Context;Educational institutions;Engineering education;Proposals;Technological innovation","computer aided instruction;educational institutions;engineering education;groupware","Burlton Hexagon;business process management;collaborative approach;critical thinking;curricular macroprocess;curriculum management process;educational innovation project;engineering education;higher education institution;innovation model;knowledge management;microcurricular redesign;teaching;universidad EAFIT","","0","","18","","","22-25 Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Tools are most effective when they embed some knowledge about the process, e.g., in terms of the typical activities required by the process, so that users can execute the activities without having to define them. Tools must be lightweight and flexible, so as to enable users to create or change the process as soon as there is a new need. In this article, we first describe an application-independent approach to flexible process support by discussing the abstractions required for modeling, creating, enacting, and modifying flexible processes. Then, we show our approach at work in the context of project-centered learning. In this application, learners are challenged to perform concrete tasks in order to master specific subjects; in doing so, they have to conduct significant projects and cope with realistic (or even real-life) working conditions and scenarios. Often, students are geographically dispersed or under severe timing constraints, because these activities intertwine with their normal university activity. As a result, they need communication technology in order to interact and workflow technology in order to organize their work. The developed platform provides a comprehensible, e-learning-specific set of activities and process templates, which can be combined through a simple Web interface into project-centered collaboration processes. We discuss how the general paradigm of flexible processes was adapted to the learning concept, implemented, and experienced by students.","1041-4347;10414347","","10.1109/TKDE.2008.134","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4564460","CASE;Hypertext/Hypermedia;Models and Principles;Web application design.;Web-based teamwork processes;e-learning;flexible processes;process design","","learning (artificial intelligence)","e-learning;flexible process support;project-centered learning;software tools","","3","","34","","20080715","June 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

By tightly coupling event logs and process models, process mining makes possible to detect deviations, predict delays, support decision making and recommend process redesigns. Event logs are data sets containing the executions (called traces) of a business process. Several process mining algorithms have been defined to mine event logs and deliver valuable models (e.g. Petri nets) of how logged processes are being executed. However, they often generate spaghetti-like process models, which can be hard to understand. This is caused by the inherent complexity of real-life processes, which tend to be less structured and more flexible than what the stakeholders typically expect. In particular, spaghetti-like process models are discovered when all possible behaviors are shown in a single model as a result of considering the set of traces in the event log all at once. To minimize this problem, trace clustering can be used as a preprocessing step. It splits up an event log into clusters of similar traces, so as to handle variability in the recorded behavior and facilitate process model discovery. In this paper, we investigate a multiple view aware approach to trace clustering, based on a co-training strategy. In an assessment, using benchmark event logs, we show that the presented algorithm is able to discover a clustering pattern of the log, such that related traces result appropriately clustered. We evaluate the significance of the formed clusters using established machine learning and process mining metrics.","1939-1374;19391374","","10.1109/TSC.2015.2430327","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7102743","Clustering;Co-training;Multiple view learning;Process mining","Aerospace electronics;Clustering algorithms;Computational modeling;Data mining;Measurement;Partitioning algorithms;Registers","","","","0","","","","20150506","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Several approaches were defined recently in the literature for predicting the performances of a single process instance. However, in many real situations, process-oriented performance metrics and associated constraints are defined in an aggregated form, on a time-window basis. This work right addresses the problem of predicting whether (the process instances in) each time window will infringe an aggregate performance constraint, at a series of checkpoints within the window. To this end, at each checkpoint, three kinds of measures are to be estimated: what performance outcome each ongoing process instance will yield, how many process instances will start in the rest of the window, and what their aggregate performance outcomes will be. The approach proposed is general (it can reuse a wide range of regression methods), and it can be embedded in a continuous monitoring-and-learning scheme.

The article discusses planning and implementation of distance learning in the HEI teaching process in connection with human, informational, and financial resources. The relevance of this study is determined not only by the need to have a tool for making decisions on the implementation of specific training programs but also allows to make transparent the core business process of the University and to show the interest of the academic staff in the mechanism and in the implementation of the customer-oriented strategy of the University. The suggested model is based on the calculation of payment for teaching, for the work on the creation of training materials and payment of tutors in distance education and on some most significant parameters of the programs' implementation process. These parameters can be either the number of students enrolled in the program or the number of ECTS credit points achieved by students in a semester or other. All of them are calculated with the use of the actual curricula for particular programs. The model allows calculating both the projected revenues and the expenses on individual items. This allows us to assess administrative decisions on the optimization of the structure of the program and the implementation of the training plans. The model has been successfully tested on four vital academic programs at Transport and Telecommunication Institute. The model and the proposed method of its application fully comply with the principles of the Bologna process and can be easily transformed for use at any European HEI.","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6240866","","Analytical models;Computational modeling;Computer aided instruction;Educational institutions;Remuneration;Training","business process re-engineering;distance learning;further education;information resources;optimisation;planning;simulation;teaching;training","ECTS credits;HEI;Transport and Telecommunication Institute;academic programs;business process;customer-oriented strategy;decision making;distance education;distance learning planning;financial resources;higher educational institution;human resources;informational resources;optimization;payment calculation;simulation model;teaching;training materials;training programs","","1","","3","","","21-25 May 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It is rare that a new product will be introduced at its steady state yield target, necessitating aggressive yield improvement planning. In particular, manufacturers who have converted portions of existing PWB capacity to PBGA product sets will find this to be true. In this paper, the authors articulate the significant challenges manufacturers face ramping up PBGA product. Complex logistics, multiple process flows, multiple customer requirements, aggressive delivery schedules, non-PWB defect mechanisms, non-functionally defined engineering specifications, and a paradigm shift in manufacturing philosophy complicate a product with great intrinsic manufacturing difficulty. This paper reviews in detail the challenges, philosophy and methodology employed to achieve dramatic improvement in PBGA product yields. The paper also includes suggestions for changes in business process procedures to ensure yield learning is engrained as part of any PBGA product introduction. A detailed system of matrix management that utilized process control as the foundation for yield improvement is included. The organization structure, review cycle, improvement road maps, yield tracking and data analysis are discussed in detail. Overall yield improvement results, along with several representative products, are generically shared to validate the philosophy and methodology employed","0569-5503;05695503","","10.1109/ECTC.1998.678804","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=678804","","Capacity planning;Gold;Manufacturing processes;Microelectronics;Packaging;Process control;Pulp manufacturing;Random access memory;Steady-state;Substrates","integrated circuit packaging;integrated circuit yield;management;production;substrates","PBGA substrate yield learning;PWB facility;aggressive yield improvement planning;business process procedures;complex logistics;delivery schedules;manufacture;matrix management;multiple customer requirements;multiple process flows;nonPWB defect mechanisms;nonfunctionally defined engineering specifications","","3","","4","","","25-28 May 1998","25 May 1998-28 May 1998","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A performance measurement system may provide an early warning detection system indicating what has happened; diagnose reason for the current situation; and indicate what remedial action should be taken. Businesses rely on performance measurement systems to provide a feedback on the health of the business. The balanced scorecard (BSC) framework suggests the use of non-financial performance measures via three additional perspectives, i.e. customer, internal business process, learning and innovation to supplement traditional financial measures, believing that if used in that way, the scorecard addresses a serious deficiency in traditional management systems: their inability to link a company's long term strategy with its short term actions. This paper highlights the issues and combination of factors that influences the adaptation of the balanced scorecard model to the IT function and draws attention to cases of organisations that have attempted to implement the balanced scorecard to their IT departments, highlighting their challenges and rewards.","","","10.1109/ICITA.2005.52","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1489066","","Art;Companies;Feedback;Financial management;Information technology;Innovation management;Measurement;Monitoring;Surges;Technological innovation","DP management;business data processing;competitive intelligence;strategic planning","BSC framework;IT functions;balanced scorecard model;nonfinancial performance measures;performance measurement system;warning detection system","","3","","11","","","4-7 July 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In order to develop an e-learning environment that supports collaborative learning one should cope with learning content, communication and collaboration facilities, technological infrastructure, and run-time execution (i.e. learning process). Collaboration scripts are employed to specify the components of the learning process including collaboration and interaction patterns within groups of participants. In this paper we present a Computer Supported Collaborative Learning platform which includes a collaboration script authoring tool based on the Business Process Modeling Notation as the model for the graphical representation of scripts. Collaboration scripts are parsed and transformed to IMS Learning Design Level C learning flows. The second important component of the platform is the run time environment which is based on the Copper Core Engine that executes the IMS Learning Design learning flows and a Message Oriented Middleware which is built over the Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol. This middleware layer enables group management and social interaction among participants. The platform integrates external learning tools by implementing the IMS Learning Tool Interoperability (IMS LTI) specification.

In the past, these systems were built based on proprietary solutions, acquired in piecemeal fashion and tightly coupled through ad hoc means. This resulted in stovepipe systems that had many duplicated functions and that were monolithic, non-extensible and non-interoperable. How to migrate from these stovepipe systems to the next-generation open healthcare information systems that are interoperable, extensible and maintainable is increasingly a pressing problem for the healthcare industry. In this paper, we present our experience in addressing the problem using an architecture-centered approach for enterprise system development and integration based on the distributed object technology standards OMA/CORBA. Our case study is conducted from a user organization (as opposed to developer organization) point of view and is based on a large-scale effort undertaken at the Baptist Health Systems of South Florida, a large healthcare organization serving the South Florida region. Key lessons learnt from this case study include: (1) establishing a clear architectural vision is essential to successful enterprise system development; (2) adoption of a standard architecture and infrastructure is the best approach to achieve interoperable, extensible and cohesive enterprise systems; and (3) an effective development methodology and business process are key to implementing the architectural vision","0730-3157;07303157","","10.1109/CMPSAC.1999.812712","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=812712","","Computer architecture;Hospitals;Information systems;Information technology;Large-scale systems;Management information systems;Medical services;Pressing;Standards development;Technology management","distributed object management;health care;integrated software;management information systems;medical information systems;open systems;software architecture;software maintenance;software standards","Baptist Health Systems of South Florida;CORBA;Common Object Request Broker Architecture;OMA;Object Management Architecture;architectural vision;architecture-centered enterprise system development;business process;business units;case study;clinics;cohesive enterprise systems;development methodology;distributed object technology standard;enterprise system integration;extensibility;geographically distributed institutions;hospitals;infrastructure;interoperability;maintainability;open healthcare information systems;physician offices;standard architecture;user organization","","0","3","15","","","1999","27 Oct 1999-29 Oct 1999","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The rules for each decision point are based on the attribute's influence to the case. Meanwhile, a non-free choice construct is a mixture of choice and synchronization, which will create limited choices in the workflow. The limitation of choice will then affect the rules found in non-free choice construct using decision mining technique. Limitation of rules makes it possible to examine the relation among rules in the workflow. The relation of these rules will emerge a certain property of a non-free choice construct. Rules for two decision points within a non-free choice construct will have similarities.

Involving the user in the development of the applications via the features that BPM brings can be a solution to this aspect, as the requirements would be specified by the domain experts and most of the difficulties of the requirements engineering process would be avoided. However, business process modeling notations seem to be a little bit complex for domain experts with reduced computer knowledge and their participation in the requirements engineering process turns complicated due to the difficulties derived from learning and using these notations. BPMN MUSIM tries to reduce the number of elements needed in a business process modeling notation to the minimum necessary and thus lowers the difficulties that domain experts experience when modeling their processes. The major problem regarding BPMN MUSIM is that there is no modeling software that enables it use, so we have decided to design and build a process modeling tool called Isastur Modeler that is used for business process modeling with BPMN MUSIM.","2166-0727;21660727","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5974209","BPMN;BPMN MUSIM;Business Process Modeling;SBPMN;Windows Workflow;jPDL;usability tests","Adaptation models;Business;Complexity theory;Computational modeling;Computers;Load modeling;Unified modeling language","business process re-engineering","BPMN MUSIM;Isastur modeler;business process modeling notations;requirements engineering process","","0","","9","","","15-18 June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We are investigating the use of open source subset of the National Institute of Health's National Library of Medicine (NIH/NLM) data for our analysis including text as well as image features to semantically link similar publications. Due to the sheer volume of data as well as the complexity of inference tasks, the initial problem is not in the analysis but lies in making a decision about the computational infrastructure to deploy and in data representation that will help accomplish our goals. Just like any other business process, reducing processing cost and time is of essence. This work benchmarks two open source platforms (A) Apache Hadoop with Apache Mahout, and (B) open source R using bigmemory package for performing non-embarrassingly parallel and embarrassingly parallel machine learning tasks. Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and k-means are used to represent these two problem classes respectively and average task time is evaluated for the two architectures for a range of input data sizes. In addition, performance of these algorithms using sparse and dense matrix representation is also evaluated for clustering and feature extraction tasks. Our analysis shows that R is not able to process data larger than 2 giga-bytes, with an exponential performance degradation for data larger than 226 mega-bytes. Bigmemory package in R allowed processing of larger data but with similar degradation beyond 226 mega-bytes. As expected, Hadoop/Mahout did not perform well for SVD as compared to k-means due to the tightly coupled nature of data needed at each step and is only justified for processing of very large data sets.","","","10.1109/BSEC.2013.6618496","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6618496","","Benchmark testing;Databases;Educational institutions;Hardware;Software;Sparse matrices;Vectors","computational complexity;inference mechanisms;learning (artificial intelligence);medical information systems;parallel processing;pattern clustering;public domain software;singular value decomposition;sparse matrices","Apache Hadoop;Apache Mahout;NIH-NLM;SVD;bigmemory package;biomedical domain;business process;clustering tasks;data representation;dense matrix representation;embarrassingly parallel problems;feature extraction tasks;gene sequence data;inference task complexity;large scale open source data;machine learning tasks;national institute of health national library of medicine;nonembarrassingly parallel problems;open source R;open source subset;singular value decomposition;sparse matrix representation;technology infrastructure benchmarking","","0","","14","","","21-23 May 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We use grounded theory to answer the research question: How do students construct knowledge in a POGIL classroom? Constructivist grounded theory was used to code student interview data and develop a theory of how student learning occurs. The resulting theory shows that the use of POGIL results in a concept-focused class, as opposed to focusing on discrete aspects of knowledge (facts). This concept-focused class provides for both conceptual understanding and improved retention of information.

Process metadata is usually specific to a standard specification - like the Business Process Modeling Notation (BPMN) or the IMS Learning Design Standard - while used process data is specific to a specific process context. These facts limit the re-usability of a process model across different standards and contexts. To overcome these issues, this paper describes an innovative semantic web service-oriented architecture aimed at changing this data- and metadata-based paradigm to a highly dynamic service-oriented approach following the idea of a semantic abstraction from process metadata as well as process data. This approach enables a dynamic adaptation to specific actor needs and objectives and supports the development of abstract semantic process models which are re-usable across different contexts and standards.

Until now, significant R&D effort has been devoted aiming towards web-based educational systems tailored to specific pedagogical approaches. As a response to pedagogical concerns towards standardization and interoperability needs, IMS learning design (IMS LD) specification was introduced. Nevertheless, despite the wide adoption of the IMS LD specification still a common language for graphically representing learning flows is missing. This is due to the fact that although the IMS LD specification provides the means for technically representing learning flows (that is, sequences of activities), it does not provide guidance on how these flows could be represented in a human understandable way. As a result, there exist several authoring tools for designing learning activities that export content packages conformant with IMS learning design, but these tools are using different representations of the learning process. On the other hand, there exist standards for creating human understandable graphical representations of processes (i.e. the business process modeling notation standard), that could be useful in providing common representations of learning flows. In this paper we examine the ability of using BPMN as a common representation notation for learning flows modeled using the business process execution language (BPEL) and present an algorithm for transforming BPEI workflows to IMS learning design level A learning flows.","2161-3761;21613761","","10.1109/ICALT.2007.261","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4281161","","Algorithm design and analysis;Digital systems;Educational technology;Electronic learning;Humans;Informatics;Packaging;Research and development;Standardization;Telematics","Internet;computer aided instruction;learning systems;visual languages","IMS learning design level A representations;IMS learning design specification;Web based educational systems;authoring tools;business process execution language;e-learning systems;graphical language;learning flows;learning process","","4","","9","","","18-20 July 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Evidences from three case studies show that organisations, which work towards a similar objective as developing a specific project output, follow productive work steps that suggest almost identical business processes. However focussing on coordination routines behind the business process, considerable differences are identified in ways of how actors communicate and coordinate their work. For example how actors know what to do next, solve problems, or drive progress form distinct, but relatively consistent patterns of activity, which can be described in the cases as task partitioning with formal coordination, ad-hoc coordination, or building shared understanding and driving maturity. The analysis of the cases also shows that there is currently little support by collaboration tools in all patterns and each pattern is better or less suited to the different types of collaborative work. The findings are analysed and lessons learnt from the cases are outlined; especially they provide some explanation for the varying productivity and results experienced. Based on the findings, we elaborate a number of recommendations for future work specifically on how to better support patterns with current as well as emerging collaboration tools and how to better identify the most appropriate coordination pattern for varying working situations.","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7458656","Organizational routines;collaboration;coordination patterns;knowledge intensive work processes;productivity","Proposals","business data processing;groupware;knowledge management;organisational aspects;productivity","business process;collaboration tool;collaborative work;coordination routine;knowledge intensive work process;organizational boundary;productivity;task partitioning","","","","19","","","4-6 June 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The increasing reliance on Information Systems (IS)such as Business Process Management (BPM) systems brought up an urgent need to ensure continuous business operations despite unexpected challenging conditions. In contrast to well-established risk-aware BPM which mainly addresses risk mitigation at design-time and only for known risks, we propose resilient BPM as a complementary approach focusing either at run-time or off-time. Such approaches seek the adjustment and maintenance of operations under disruption. We report on our ongoing work towards the development of a decision support framework to realize resilience in the BPM context. For this approach, measuring resilience on a process level is crucial, since it provides information that allow for better decision-making, learning, and improvement. Nevertheless, there are no suitable holistic measurement systems for resilient BPM available by now. Specifically, this paper motivates the need for operational resilience measurement at the level of processes. It presents the components and operation of our measurement framework, which helps to detect resilience properties of processes based on measures by analyzing process-logs. This information is then exploited to drive a resilience-oriented decision support to increase process resilience.","","","10.1109/ARES.2015.68","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7299925","","Context;Current measurement;Organizations;Resilience;Time measurement","business continuity;business data processing;decision making;decision support systems;management information systems;risk management","BPM system;business process management;continuous business operation;decision making;decision support framework;holistic measurement system;information systems;interconnected complex IT-systems;operational resilience measurement;operational risks;process resilience;process-centered resilience framework;process-log analysis;resilience-oriented decision support;risk mitigation;risk-aware BPM;turbulent organizational environment;uncertain disruptive effects","","","","51","","","24-27 Aug. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We adopted a context-oriented and process-oriented pedagogical approach in designing the mobile learning trail conducted at Singapore Sentosa Island. Activities were categorized into performative and knowledge-generative on a continuum from well-structured to ill-structured activities. To examine the impact of activity design on discourse types, all audio-recorded verbal data of the three groups of secondary students was analysed with respect to two key dimensions in the knowledge construction process, namely, the epistemic and the social. Analysis showed that activity types and physical affordances of the learning environment have a definitive bearing on group discursive moves. Importantly, the presence of a real world context could generate critical thinking and collaborative knowledge building even for mundane performative activities when they are embedded with unforeseen contextual variables. We argue that the design of activity and the degree of its structuredness, and the assumed desired learning outcomes, are very much subjected to the affordances of physical and social resources in the mobile learning environment-a missing dimension that could possibly be overlooked and understudied.","1939-1382;19391382","","10.1109/TLT.2014.2376951","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6975240","Activity Design;Collaborative learning;Discourse;Mobile Learning;Physical Affordance;activity design;discourse;mobile learning;physical affordance","Collaboration;Collaborative work;Context;Educational institutions;Mediation;Mobile communication;Mobile handsets","computer aided instruction;mobile learning","Singapore Sentosa Island;activity design impact;activity discourse;audio-recorded verbal data;collaborative knowledge building;context-oriented pedagogical approach;contextual learning experience design;critical thinking;discourse types;epistemic process;group discursive moves;ill-structured activities;knowledge construction process;knowledge-generative activities;mobile learning environment;mobile learning trail;mundane performative activities;performative activities;physical resource affordance;process-oriented pedagogical approach;real world platform;secondary students;social process;social resource affordance;structuredness degree;unforeseen contextual variables;well-structured activities","","0","","43","","20141204","Jan.-March 1 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

But complaints on software quality are getting more and more common. Software quality depends on many factors and sometimes also universities are blamed - they do not teach the essential skills, that software engineering (SE) education provides too theoretical or old-fashioned courses. Curriculum is a complex emerging system; here are analyzed factors which influence it. The main conclusion is that software is a process and its quality follows from the process quality. Process quality is reached by disciplined practices during the development. Traditionally, software development is based on the predefined path of development phases, which all have their purpose, base practices and outcomes. Opposite to this, there is a trend towards light process oriented software development culture - agile development. In this approach, team work, active role of the client, and incremental product architecture is important. Software development is highly human oriented sector of industry. Productivity can not be increased - at least not dramatically - by tools and automation. New approaches in software industry are based on higher level of automation and reuse of available software assets. Large scale software development is based on reusable platforms, product families, artifacts developed by component factories, but finally especially in the intelligence of the professionals modifying and further developing the available artifacts. In spite of the improvement in automation in ""large scale"" software development, the main part of software is still developed in very traditional way - from the scratch based on careful user requirements elicitation, specification, system design and implementation. SE curriculum should correspond to the industry needs, only then can universities produce highly skilled professionals, which can satisfy needs of software in- ustry. Development of curricula is supported also by different standards, frameworks and recommendations developed by different interest groups, but the role of these ""global"" curricula models in the development of high quality university curricula should not be over-estimated. Different approaches in SE curriculum development are introduced. The experiences of authors provide a path of tested ""good practices"" towards a new curriculum structure implemented in the organizations of the authors.","","","10.1109/ICCCYB.2006.305731","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4097692","","Computer architecture;Computer industry;Educational institutions;Humans;Information technology;Large-scale systems;Manufacturing automation;Programming;Software engineering;Software quality","computer science education;educational courses;software engineering","IT curriculum;agile development;complex emerging process;information technology;software development;software engineering education;software industry;software quality","","2","","28","","","20-22 Aug. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

E-learning is becoming more popular day by day and organizations tend to emphasize on its benefits. Almost all organizations have been transformed from traditional learning to e-Learning. Does this mean that e-learning is without limitations? This new mode of learning is not based on the moral and behavioral ethics. Additionally, e-Learning organizations do not take into consideration any means or effort to prevent unethical behaviors of student. On the other hand, Islam emphasizes greatly on ethics and has its own philosophy of teaching and learning. The main aim of this research is to identify the challenges of e-Learning and propose a model for e-learning which might be a roadmap for all organizations all over the world to adopt it.
